A
Finds roots of the function: f(x)=(x+4)^2 using Newton's method
x_root =
  -3.99121 
Exact result=-4 


Finds extremums of Rosenbrock's valley function f(x,y)=(1-x)^2+100*(y-x^2)^2 
x_min =
         1 
         1 
Exact result= (1,1) 


B
Finds the lowest root ε0 of the equation M(ε)=0 for rmax = 8
ε0 =
 -0.499975 
Exact result=-1/2 
The resulting function are plotted in Hydrogen.pyxplot.png along with the exact function


C
Uses the boundary condition f(rmax)=0 to investigate convergence of the solution as a function of rmax
Convergence shown in C1.pyxplot.png
Uses the boundary condition f(rmax->infinity)= r*exp(-k*r) instead, where k = sqrt(-2ε)
Convergence shown in C2.pyxplot.png
Compared in C1AndC2.pyxplot.png
It is clear that C2 converges faster
